# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The manager at Pewlett-Hackard has given me two more challenges 
  1) Discover the amount of retiring employees by title
  2) Find the employees who qualify to participate in the company mentorship program

After determining and sharing this information the big question to answer is - is Pewlett-Hackard prepared to successfully transition the amount of retiring employees and handle the intake of Pewlett-Hackard newcomers?
  
## Results
After organizing all of the pertinent company data and organizing it into multiple tables, a few key points were discovered


## Summary
- 90,398 employees are expected to retire and partake in the silver tsunami
- 1,549 employees qualift for mentorship eligibility
