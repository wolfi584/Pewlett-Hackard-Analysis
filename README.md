# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The manager at Pewlett-Hackard has given me two challenges: 
  1) Discover the amount of retiring employees by title
  2) Find the employees who qualify to participate in the company mentorship program

After determining and sharing this information the big question to answer is - will Pewlett-Hackard be prepared to successfully transition the amount of retiring employees and handle the intake of Pewlett-Hackard newcomers?
  
## Results
After organizing company data and sorting it into multiple tables, a few key points were discovered:
- For every 58.4 employees retiring, 1 employee is available for the mentorship program
- Pewlett-Hackard does not have enough mentors to support the new incoming employees after everyone from the silver tsunami retires
- I recommend expanding the spectrum of current employees who qualify to be mentors by enlarging the birth year from 1965 to at least 1963-1965. This would lower the mentor to employee ratio from 1 to 58.4 to roughly 1 to 20. 
- Mentorship alone is not enough when it comes to supporting an influx of new employees. There needs to be an increase in support in numerious departements, starting with human resources. Besides having support from a management persepective, new employees need to be introduced to and brought up in the company culture. This will increase their chances of becoming long term Pewlett-Hackard employees.


## Summary
- 90,398 employees are expected to retire and partake in the silver tsunami
- 1,549 employees qualift for mentorship eligibility
- Two queries I recommend adding to this process are: 1) How much would the number of mentorship eligible employees increase if we expand the birth year in the search from 1965 to 1963-1965? 2) Are their enough mentors available in each department to help incoming employees?
